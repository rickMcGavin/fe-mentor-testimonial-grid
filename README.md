### What I learned

My main goal here was to build a project using CSS grid. I had put off learning it for a while, and I decided to go through the [CSS grid garden course](https://cssgridgarden.com/). To further solidify this knowledge, I found this project on Frontend Mentor and decided to build it using CSS grid.

The best thing I learned was that I can use CSS grid for some layouts that I used to use flexbox for, and I can do it with less markup. Flexbox tends to require that you wrap content in a container, and then wrap that container in another container. With CSS grid, I can just wrap the content in a single container and use grid to position it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - This is a great resource for learning CSS grid. It's a game that teaches you how to use CSS grid. I highly recommend it.
